;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put one-key-apropos.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'one-key-apropos)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; 
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET one-key-apropos RET
